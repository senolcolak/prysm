# RadosGW Usage Exporter (remote producer)

## Overview

The **RadosGW Usage Exporter (Prysm Remote Producer)** is a tool designed to
collect and export detailed usage metrics from RadosGW (Rados Gateway)
instances. This exporter gathers data on operations, byte metrics, bucket
usage, quotas, and exposes metrics for Prometheus, providing comprehensive
visibility into the usage and performance of your RadosGW environment.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Metric Collection**: Gathers a wide range of metrics
  including operations, bytes sent/received, bucket usage, quotas, and more.
- **NATS KV Sync Control**: Uses NATS JetStream Key-Value buckets for sync and
  aggregation state.
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Exposes usage metrics in Prometheus format, allowing
  easy integration with monitoring dashboards.
- **Configurable**: Offers flexibility in configuration via command-line flags
  or environment variables.

## Usage

To run the Prysm remote producer for RadosGW usage, use the following command:

```bash
prysm remote-producer radosgw-usage [flags]
```

## Example Flags:

- `--admin-url "http://rgw-admin-url"`: Admin URL for the RadosGW instance.
- `--access-key "your-access-key"`: Access key for the RadosGW admin.
- `--secret-key "your-secret-key"`: Secret key for the RadosGW admin.
- `--interval 10`: Interval in seconds between usage collections (default is 10
  seconds).
- `--rgw-cluster-id`: RGW Cluster ID added to metrics.
- `--prometheus`: Enable Prometheus metrics.
- `--prometheus-port 8080`: Port for Prometheus metrics (default is 8080).

## Environment Variables

Configuration can also be set through environment variables:

- `ADMIN_URL`: Admin URL for the RadosGW instance.
- `ACCESS_KEY`: Access key for the RadosGW admin.
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for the RadosGW admin.
- `NODE_NAME`: Name of the node.
- `INSTANCE_ID`: Instance ID.
- `PROMETHEUS_ENABLED`: Enable Prometheus metrics.
- `PROMETHEUS_PORT`: Port for Prometheus metrics.
- `INTERVAL`: Interval in seconds between usage collections.
- `RGW_CLUSTER_ID`: RGW Cluster ID added to metrics.

## Metrics Collected

The RadosGW Usage Exporter collects and exposes the following metrics:


### Bucket / User Usage Metrics

- `radosgw_user_buckets_total`: Total number of buckets for each user.
- `radosgw_user_objects_total`: Total number of objects for each user.
- `radosgw_user_data_size_bytes`: Total size of data for each user in bytes

### Quota Metrics

- `radosgw_usage_bucket_quota_enabled`: Indicates if quota is enabled for the
  bucket.
- `radosgw_usage_bucket_quota_size`: Maximum allowed bucket size.
- `radosgw_usage_bucket_quota_size_objects`: Maximum allowed number of objects
  in the bucket.
- `radosgw_usage_user_quota_enabled`: Indicates if user quota is enabled.
- `radosgw_usage_user_quota_size`: Maximum allowed size for the user.
- `radosgw_usage_user_quota_size_objects`: Maximum allowed number of objects
  across all user buckets.

### Shards and User Metadata

- `radosgw_usage_bucket_shards`: Number of shards in the bucket.
- `radosgw_user_metadata`: User metadata (e.g., display name, email, storage
  class).


## Example Workflow

- Start the exporter with the desired configuration:

```bash
prysm remote-producer radosgw-usage --admin-url "http://rgw-admin-url" --access-key "your-access-key" --secret-key "your-secret-key" --rgw-cluster-id "rgw-cluster-id" --prometheus --prometheus-port 8080
```

- Metrics such as operations, bytes sent/received, and bucket usage will be
  collected every 10 seconds (default) and can be monitored through Prometheus.

## Acknowledgment

The basic idea for the RadosGW Usage Exporter and the prefix for metrics were
inspired by the work done in the [RadosGW Usage
Exporter](https://github.com/blemmenes/radosgw_usage_exporter) by Blemmenes.
This project provided valuable insights and foundational concepts that have
been adapted and expanded upon in this implementation. We extend our thanks to
the original authors for their contributions to the open-source community.
