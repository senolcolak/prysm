# Prysm - Comprehensive Observability CLI Tool for Ceph and Rados Gateway Monitoring

> **Disclaimer**
>
> Prysm is currently under heavy development and may contain bugs, incomplete
> features, and non-functional code. This project is in the testing and
> proof-of-concept stage, so please use it with caution and be aware that it
> may not work as expected. Contributions and feedback are appreciated as we
> continue to improve and stabilize the tool.

## Overview

Prysm is a versatile CLI tool designed to provide an efficient observability
solution for a wide range of systems, including RadosGW (Rados Gateway), Ceph
storage clusters, and various hardware components. With a multi-layered
architecture, Prysm enables real-time monitoring, data collection, and analysis
across diverse environments. It ensures optimal performance, compliance, and
operational insights.

## Features

- Multi-system Support: Prysm supports RadosGW, Ceph clusters, and hardware
  monitoring, making it a comprehensive observability tool.
- Flexible Architecture: Prysm’s four-layered architecture—Consumers, NATS,
  Remote Producers, and Nearby Producers—enables it to handle a variety of
  observability tasks with precision and scalability.
- Diverse Data Collection: Collect and analyze metrics and logs from RadosGW,
  Ceph, and hardware devices such as disks. Producers can be configured to
  gather data locally or remotely, ensuring adaptability to different
  environments.
- Real-time Messaging: Use NATS as the messaging backbone to enable real-time,
  low-latency communication between data producers and consumers, ensuring
  seamless data flow.
- Customizable Output: Prysm supports multiple output formats, including
  console, NATS, and Prometheus, allowing you to tailor the tool to your
  specific observability requirements.
- Standalone Functionality: Prysm can be used standalone for specific tasks,
  such as providing a metrics endpoint for Prometheus, checking disk health, or
  printing data directly to the console.

## Components

### Consumers

Purpose:

- Process and analyze data received from various systems, including RadosGW,
  Ceph, and hardware components.

Key Responsibilities:

- Generate alerts based on predefined conditions.
- Store and analyze logs for troubleshooting and auditing.
- Display real-time metrics on dashboards.
- Perform advanced analytics and usage reporting.
- Ensure regulatory compliance through log and metrics analysis.

### NATS

Purpose:

- Acts as the messaging backbone for the system.

Key Responsibilities:

- Route messages between producers and consumers.
- Handle high volumes of messages with low latency.
- Ensure reliable message delivery even in the face of network issues.

### Remote Producers

Purpose:

- Collect metrics and logs from various systems via APIs or other interfaces,
  typically from outside the monitored environment.

Key Responsibilities:

- Gather data using appropriate APIs or interfaces.
- Transmit collected data to NATS.
- Operate with minimal configuration, focusing on remote accessibility.

[RadosGW Usage Exporter](pkg/producers/radosgwusage/README.md)

### Nearby Producers

Purpose:

- Allows direct access to logs, metrics, and configuration files. Deployed
  within the same network or environment as the monitored systems.

Key Responsibilities:

- Collect data directly from system log files, metrics endpoints, or hardware
  sensors (e.g., SMART attributes for disk health).
- Leverage proximity for lower latency and higher data fidelity.
- Transmit collected data to NATS.

[Resource Usage](pkg/producers/resourceusage/README.md)

## Usage

Prysm can be employed across a wide range of observability scenarios, from
monitoring the health of Ceph storage clusters and RadosGW instances to
ensuring the reliability of hardware components through SMART attribute
analysis. Whether you need to integrate with Prometheus, send real-time alerts
via NATS, or simply log and visualize system performance, Prysm offers the
tools and flexibility to meet your needs.
